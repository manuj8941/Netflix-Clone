Designing a Movie Trailer Website with the Help of TMDb API and Axios Library

The website is designed to produce movie trailers and other movie information.
The website uses the API key from The Movie Database (TMDb) to retrieve data about movies and trailers.
The API key is stored in a constant variable called apiKey.
The website has a search box where users can type in the name of a movie.
When the user clicks on the "search" button, the input is captured and sent as a parameter to a function called findMovieString that constructs a query string to search for movies in TMDb's database.
The axios library is used to make asynchronous HTTP requests to TMDb's API.
If the search returns no results, an error message is displayed.
If the search returns one or more results, the movie information is displayed in a container element.
The movie information displayed includes the title, original title, overview, poster path, release date, original language, and trailer.
The website also has a "show more" button that expands the movie overview if it is longer than 150 characters.
The website uses functions to construct links to the movie poster and trailer on YouTube.
If a trailer is available, the website embeds the trailer using an iframe element.
If a trailer is not available, the website uses a search query to find a trailer on YouTube and embeds the trailer using an iframe element.
The website also displays a footer element.
